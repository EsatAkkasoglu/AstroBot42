This thermal emission leads to a slow decrease in the mass of the black hole and to its eventual disappearance: any primordial black hole of mass less than about 10<SUP>15</SUP> g would have evaporated by now. Although these quantum effects violate the classical law that the area of the event horizon of a black hole cannot decrease, there remains a Generalized Second Law: S+1/4 A never decreases where S is the entropy of matter outside black holes and A is the sum of the surface areas of the event horizons. This shows that gravitational collapse converts the baryons and leptons in the collapsing body into entropy. It is tempting to speculate that this might be the reason why the U...'},\n",

The structure and radiation spectrum of the disk depend, mainly on the rate of matter inflow A into the disk at its external boundary The dependence on the efficiency of mechanisms of angular momentum transport (connected with the magnetic field and turbulence) is weaker. If A = 1O- 3.1O-8 M0 the disk around the black hole is a year powerful source of X-ray radiation with hv 1- 10 keV and luminosity L 1O - 1038 erg/s. If the flux of the accreting matter decreases, the effective temperature of the radiation and the luminosity will drop. On the other hand, when M &gt; 1O- M0 the optical luminosity year of the disk exceeds the solar value. The main contribution to the optical luminosity of the black hole arises from reradiation of that part of the X-ray and ultra-violet energy which is initially produced in the central high temperature regions of the disk and which is then absorbe...'},\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'QUANTUM gravitational effects are usually ignored in calculations of the formation and evolution of black holes. The justification for this is that the radius of curvature of space-time outside the event horizon is very large compared to the Planck length (Għ/c<SUP>3</SUP>)<SUP>1/2</SUP> ~ 10<SUP>-33</SUP> cm, the length scale on which quantum fluctuations of the metric are expected to be of order unity. This means that the energy density of particles created by the gravitational field is small compared to the space-time curvature.

       "  'Abstract': 'There are a number of similarities between black-hole physics and thermodynamics. Most striking is the similarity in the behaviors of black-hole area and of entropy: Both quantities tend to increase irreversibly. In this paper we make this similarity the basis of a thermodynamic approach to black-hole physics. After a brief review of the elements of the theory of information, we discuss black-hole physics from the point of view of information theory. We show that it is natural to introduce the concept of black-hole entropy as the measure of information about a black-hole interior which is inaccessible to an exterior observer. Considerations of simplicity and consistency, and dimensional arguments indicate that the black-hole entropy is equal to the ratio of the black-hole area to the square of the Planck length times a dimensionless constant of order unity. A different approach making use of the specific properties of Kerr black holes and of concepts from information theory leads to the same conclusion, and s...'},\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'On September 14, 2015 at 09:50:45 UTC the two detectors of the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory simultaneously observed a transient gravitational-wave signal. The signal sweeps upwards in frequency from 35 to 250 Hz with a peak gravitational-wave strain of 1.0 ×10<SUP>-21</SUP>. It matches the waveform predicted by general relativity for the inspiral and merger of a pair of black holes and the ringdown of the resulting single black hole.

       "  'Abstract': \"Supermassive black holes (BHs) have been found in 85 galaxies by dynamical modeling of spatially resolved kinematics. The Hubble Space Telescope revolutionized BH research by advancing the subject from its proof-of-concept phase into quantitative studies of BH demographics. Most influential was the discovery of a tight correlation between BH mass [Formula: see text] and the velocity dispersion σ of the bulge component of the host galaxy. Together with similar correlations with bulge luminosity and mass, this led to the widespread belief that BHs and bulges coevolve by regulating each other's growth. Conclusions based on one set of correlations from [Formula: see text] in brightest cluster ellipticals to [Formula: see text] in the smallest galaxies dominated BH work for more than a decade. New results are now replacing this simple story with a richer and more plausible picture in which BHs correlate differently with different galaxy components. A reasonable aim is to use this progress to refine our understandi...\"},\n",

       "  'Abstract': 'We present the first Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) observations of Sagittarius A* (Sgr A*), the Galactic center source associated with a supermassive black hole. These observations were conducted in 2017 using a global interferometric array of eight telescopes operating at a wavelength of λ = 1.3 mm. The EHT data resolve a compact emission region with intrahour variability. A variety of imaging and modeling analyses all support an image that is dominated by a bright, thick ring with a diameter of 51.8 ± 2.3 μas (68% credible interval). The ring has modest azimuthal brightness asymmetry and a comparatively dim interior. Using a large suite of numerical simulations, we demonstrate that the EHT images of Sgr A* are consistent with the expected appearance of a Kerr black hole with mass ~4 × 10<SUP>6</SUP> M <SUB>⊙</SUB>, which is inferred to exist at this location based on previous infrared observations of individual stellar orbits, as well as maser proper-motion studies.

However, unambiguous proof that this object is indeed a black hole is still lacking. A defining characteristic of a black hole is the event horizon. To a distant observer, the event horizon casts a relatively large ``shadow'' with an apparent diameter of ~10 gravitational radii that is due to the bending of light by the black hole, and this shadow is nearly independent of the black hole spin or orientation. The predicted size (~30 μas) of this shadow for Sgr A* approaches the resolution of current radio interferometers. If the black hole is maximally spinning and viewed edge-on, then the shadow will be offset by ~8 μas from the center of mass and will be slightly flattened on one side. Taking into account the scatter broadening of the image in the interstellar medium and the finite achievable telescope resolution, we show that ...\"},\n",

After discussing briefly the significance of these Galactic black holes to both astronomy and physics, we present basic data for all 40 systems, review the physics of mass accretion onto black holes, and then show seven-year light curves of 20 systems. The second half of this work is a far-reaching review of the canonical emission states of black hole binaries, which is based on X-ray, radio and gamma-ray data. For several selected black holes, we show 33 pairs of X-ray energy and power density spectra and use these spectra as a basis for introducing modified definitions of the canonical X-ray emission states of an accreting black hole. We highlight the physical structures and some of the emission mechanisms associated with each emission state. In the final pages we examine both low- and high-frequency quasi-periodic oscillations.

It is shown that only a certain type of fluctuation favors the formation of primordial black holes and that, consequently, their spectrum should always have a particular form. Since both the fluctuations which arise naturally and the fluctuations which are often invoked to explain galaxy formation are of the required type, primordial black holes could have had an important effect on the evolution of the universe. Although primordial black holes are unlikely to have a critical density, big ones could have been sufficiently numerous to act as condensation nuclei for galaxies. Observational limits on the spectrum of primordial black holes place strong constraints on the magnitude of density fluctuations in the early universe and support the assumption that the early universe was nearly Friedmann rather than chaotic.

       "  'Abstract': 'Black hole accretion flows can be divided into two broad classes: cold and hot. Whereas cold accretion flows consist of cool optically thick gas and are found at relatively high mass accretion rates, hot accretion flows, the topic of this review, are virially hot and optically thin, and occur at lower mass accretion rates. They are described by accretion solutions such as the advection-dominated accretion flow and luminous hot accretion flow. Because of energy advection, the radiative efficiency of these flows is in general lower than that of a standard thin accretion disk. Moreover, the efficiency decreases with decreasing mass accretion rate. Observations show that hot accretion flows are associated with jets. In addition, theoretical arguments suggest that hot flows should produce strong winds. Hot accretion flows are believed to be present in low-luminosity active galactic nuclei and in black hole X-ray binaries in the hard and quiescent states.

This allows us to reconstruct event-horizon-scale images of the supermassive black hole candidate in the center of the giant elliptical galaxy M87. We have resolved the central compact radio source as an asymmetric bright emission ring with a diameter of 42 ± 3 μas, which is circular and encompasses a central depression in brightness with a flux ratio ≳10:1. The emission ring is recovered using different calibration and imaging schemes, with its diameter and width remaining stable over four different observations carried out in different days.

The logarithm of this number can be regarded as the entropy of the black hole and is a measure of the amount of information about the initial state which was lost in the formation of the black hole. If one makes the hypothesis that the entropy is finite, one can deduce that the black holes must emit thermal radiation at some nonzero temperature. Conversely, the recently derived quantum-mechanical result that black holes do emit thermal radiation at temperature κℏ2π k c, where κ is the surface gravity, enables one to prove that the entropy is finite and is equal to c<SUP>3</SUP>A4 Gℏ, where A is the surface area of the event horizon or boundary of the black hole.

The primary falls in the mass gap predicted by (pulsational) pair-instability supernova theory, in the approximate range 65-120 M<SUB>⊙</SUB>. The probability that at least one of the black holes in GW190521 is in that range is 99.0%. The final mass of the merger ( ${142}_{-16}^{+28}$ M<SUB>⊙</SUB>) classifies it as an intermediate-mass black hole. Under the assumption of a quasi-circular BBH coalescence, we detail the physical properties of GW190521's source binary and its post-merger remnant, including component masses and spin vectors. Three different waveform models, as well as direct comparison to numerical solutions of general relativity, yield consistent estimates of these properties....\"},\n",

The interaction as well as non-interaction among the two sectors will also be considered. The differential equation for the dark energy density parameter, including the expression of the equation of state and deceleration parameters, are derived. The analysis of deceleration parameter clearly shows the universe to transit from decelerated to accelerated phase around z ≈ 0 . 6 . The most recent 30 H(z) data samples and the 580 Union 2.1 SNIa data set were also used to limit the theoretical results.

The theory is an extension of the vector field model of mimetic dark matter, where a scalar field is also incorporated, and it is known to be free from ghost instability. In the absence of interactions between the scalar field and the vector field, the obtained cosmological solution corresponds to the General theory of Relativity (GR) with a minimally-coupled scalar field. However, including an interaction term between the scalar field and the vector field yields interesting dynamics. There is a shift symmetry for the scalar field with a flat potential, and the conserved Noether current, which is associated with the symmetry, behaves as a dark matter component. Consequently, the solution contains a cosmological constant, dark matter and a stiff matter fluid. Breaking the shift symmetry with a non-flat potential gives a natural interaction between dark energy and dark matter.</td><td>December 2023</td><td>2023PDU....4201280B</td><td>42</td><td>2</td></tr>\n",

The model is inspired by the cubic curvature invariant formed by the contraction of three Riemann tensors. A combination of Ricci scalar and the cubic invariant is used to describe the infrared cutoff of the holographic dark energy. Such a construction is extremely useful since the evolution does not depend on the past or future features of the universe, but completely on its present features. Moreover, the use of invariants makes the theory more fundamental in nature. We have constructed the model and studied its cosmological features. The analytical solutions of various cosmological parameters such as the density parameter, equation of state parameter, and deceleration parameter are extracted and their behaviour is studied. It is seen that the holographic dark energy model can exhibit all the cosmological epoch, sequentially starting from radiation in the early universe, followed by matter, and finally the dark energy dominated epoch at late times. The equation of state parameter shows that the model can exhibit quintessence nature, phantom-divide crossing, and even phantom nature depending on the choice of parameter spaces.</td><td>December 2023</td><td>2023PDU....4201307R</td><td>42</td><td>2</td></tr>\n",

In the framework of proposed metric-affine theory, the gravity field is described by the standard Einstein tensor, which depends only on the metric tensor and its derivatives. The nonmetricity and torsion are considered as property of space-time, which is source gravity that can be interpreted as a specific (maybe dark) form of matter and energy. This form of matter and energy, which are described by nonmetricity and torsion tensors, are sources of &quot;metric&quot; gravity. For the observers, these non-metric properties are manifested as the specific properties of perfect (or non-perfect) fluid interacting with metric gravity only. The proposed metric-affine theory cannot be considered as standard theory of metric-affine gravity. The suggested theory is the metric theory of gravity and the affine theory of a specific (dark) form of matter and energy. The stress-energy tensor of this specific matter and energy is described by the non-metric part of the generalized (metric-affine) Einstein tensor. The specific matter and energy manifest itself as specific perfect or non-perfect fluid (and its energy), which interacts with standard matter only through gravity. The non-metric part is described as a stress-energy tensor, which is supposed to be considered as a candidate for the role of a stress-energy tensor of dark matter/energy. The article discusses a potential possibility to assume that nonmetricity simulates dark matter/energy by introducing a new source term of gravity into general relativity.</td><td>December 2023</td><td>2023PDU....4201326T</td><td>42</td><td>0</td></tr>\n",

To this aim, in the context of a homogeneous and isotropic universe, we first consider a generic model where the dark energy contribution is provided by an unknown function of barotropic fluids. Afterwards, we compute the deceleration and jerk parameters, evaluating at our epoch, namely z = 0 , and at z =z&lt;SUB&gt;eq&lt;/SUB&gt; .

J.&apos;]</td><td>The Ricci flow and the early universe</td><td>A framework of quantum spacetime reference frame is proposed and reviewed, in which the quantum spacetime at the Gaussian approximation is deformed by the Ricci flow. At sufficient large scale, the Ricci flow not only smooths out local small irregularities making the universe a homogeneous and isotropic Friedmann-Robertson-Walker metric, but also develops a local singularity at the physical-time origin. Due to the phenomenological suppression of the non-Gaussian primordial perturbations, we assume the validity of the Ricci flow applying to the high curvature region near the local singularity of the early universe. The no-local-collapsing theorem of Perelman ensures the existence of a canonical neighborhood around the large curvature pinching point, which resembles a gradient shrinking Ricci soliton (GSRS) solution of the Ricci flow. Without any inflaton field, the GSRS naturally reproduces an exact inflationary deSitter universe near the singularity at the leading order. Without any rolling-down behavior of inflaton, the deviation from exact deSitter described by the &quot;slow roll parameters&quot; can be calculated by a small deviation from the singular flow-time via the Ricci flow, and the primordial perturbations can also be studied on the GSRS background, the power spectrum of the scalar perturbation agrees with present observations, and the one of the tensor perturbation is predicted too small to be detectable than the standard inflation. The previous treatment of the cosmological constant and the effective gravity are also briefly reviewed in the framework. So we argue that the Ricci flow provides us a possible unified view and treatment of the late epoch accelerating expansion and early epoch inflation of the universe without introducing dark energy or inflaton (dark energy of the second kind).</td><td>November 2023</td><td>2023AnPhy.45869452L</td><td>458</td><td>3</td></tr>\n",

In this paper, we investigate cosmic shear data from the Dark Energy Survey (DES) Year 3. The non-linear suppression of the matter power spectrum required to resolve the S&lt;SUB&gt;8&lt;/SUB&gt; tension between DES and the Planck ΛCDM model is not as strong as inferred using KiDS data, but is still more extreme than predictions from recent numerical simulations. An alternative possibility is that non-standard dark matter contributes to the required suppression. We investigate the redshift and scale dependence of the suppression of the matter power spectrum.

However, in the third case, the depicted behavior exhibits a phantom-like nature. It is important to note that irrespective of the case, the generalized holographic dark energy model supports the transition from deceleration to acceleration, aligning well with observational data. Furthermore, our findings establish that the generalized holographic dark energy model endorses the universe&apos;s accelerated expansion within the framework of dynamical Chern-Simons modified gravity theory.</td><td>November 2023</td><td>2023NewA..10402084A</td><td>104</td><td>0</td></tr>\n",

The galaxy redshift sample from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) will have a significant overlap with major ongoing imaging surveys specifically designed for weak lensing measurements: the Kilo-Degree Survey (KiDS), the Dark Energy Survey (DES), and the Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC) survey. In this work, we analyse simulated redshift and lensing catalogues to establish a new strategy for combining high-quality cosmological imaging and spectroscopic data, in view of the first-year data assembly analysis of DESI. In a test case fitting for a reduced parameter set, we employ an optimal data compression scheme able to identify those aspects of the data that are most sensitive to cosmological information and amplify them with respect to other aspects of the data. We find this optimal compression approach is able to preserve all the information related to the growth of structures.</td><td>November 2023</td><td>2023MNRAS.525.3865R</td><td>525</td><td>0</td></tr>\n",

The theory is an extension of the vector field model of mimetic dark matter, where a scalar field is also incorporated, and it is known to be free from ghost instability. In the absence of interactions between the scalar field and the vector field, the obtained cosmological solution corresponds to the General theory of Relativity (GR) with a minimally-coupled scalar field. However, including an interaction term between the scalar field and the vector field yields interesting dynamics. There is a shift symmetry for the scalar field with a flat potential, and the conserved Noether current, which is associated with the symmetry, behaves as a dark matter component. Consequently, the solution contains a cosmological constant, dark matter and a stiff matter fluid. Breaking the shift symmetry with a non-flat potential gives a natural interaction between dark energy and dark matter.</td><td>2023-12-00</td><td>2023PDU....4201280B</td><td>[&apos;2022PrPNP.12503948A&apos;, &apos;2023CQGra..40p5007V&apos;]</td></tr>\n",

The model is inspired by the cubic curvature invariant formed by the contraction of three Riemann tensors. A combination of Ricci scalar and the cubic invariant is used to describe the infrared cutoff of the holographic dark energy. Such a construction is extremely useful since the evolution does not depend on the past or future features of the universe, but completely on its present features. Moreover, the use of invariants makes the theory more fundamental in nature. We have constructed the model and studied its cosmological features. The analytical solutions of various cosmological parameters such as the density parameter, equation of state parameter, and deceleration parameter are extracted and their behaviour is studied. It is seen that the holographic dark energy model can exhibit all the cosmological epoch, sequentially starting from radiation in the early universe, followed by matter, and finally the dark energy dominated epoch at late times. The equation of state parameter shows that the model can exhibit quintessence nature, phantom-divide crossing, and even phantom nature depending on the choice of parameter spaces.</td><td>2023-12-00</td><td>2023PDU....4201307R</td><td>[&apos;2023CaJPh.101..460M&apos;, &apos;2023arXiv230602924B&apos;]</td></tr>\n",

In the framework of proposed metric-affine theory, the gravity field is described by the standard Einstein tensor, which depends only on the metric tensor and its derivatives. The nonmetricity and torsion are considered as property of space-time, which is source gravity that can be interpreted as a specific (maybe dark) form of matter and energy. This form of matter and energy, which are described by nonmetricity and torsion tensors, are sources of &quot;metric&quot; gravity. For the observers, these non-metric properties are manifested as the specific properties of perfect (or non-perfect) fluid interacting with metric gravity only. The proposed metric-affine theory cannot be considered as standard theory of metric-affine gravity. The suggested theory is the metric theory of gravity and the affine theory of a specific (dark) form of matter and energy. The stress-energy tensor of this specific matter and energy is described by the non-metric part of the generalized (metric-affine) Einstein tensor. The specific matter and energy manifest itself as specific perfect or non-perfect fluid (and its energy), which interacts with standard matter only through gravity. The non-metric part is described as a stress-energy tensor, which is supposed to be considered as a candidate for the role of a stress-energy tensor of dark matter/energy. The article discusses a potential possibility to assume that nonmetricity simulates dark matter/energy by introducing a new source term of gravity into general relativity.</td><td>2023-12-00</td><td>2023PDU....4201326T</td><td>[None]</td></tr>\n",

In plane-point geometry we show how to compute the contribution of the quantum force to the phase shift observable in atom interferometers. We show that atom interferometry is likely to become a competitive search method for light particles bilinearly coupled to matter, provided that the interferometer arms have lengths below ∼ 10 cm.</td><td>2023-12-00</td><td>2023PDU....4201294B</td><td>[&apos;2022PhRvD.106j5022A&apos;]</td></tr>\n",

The detached SDOs with orbits beyond the reach of Neptune (roughly q &amp;gt; 35 au) are of special interest here as an important constraint on the early evolution of the outer Solar System. The semimajor axis profile of detached SDOs at 50-500 au, as characterized from the Dark Energy Survey (DES), is radially extended, but previous dynamical models of Neptune&apos;s early migration produce a relatively compact profile. This problem is most likely related to Sun&apos;s birth environment in a stellar cluster. We perform new dynamical simulations that account for cluster effects and show that the orbital distribution of SDOs can be explained if a particularly close stellar encounter occurred early on (e.g., M dwarf with the mass ≃ 0 . 2M&lt;SUB&gt;⊙&lt;/SUB&gt; approaching the Sun at ≃ 200 au).

To this aim, in the context of a homogeneous and isotropic universe, we first consider a generic model where the dark energy contribution is provided by an unknown function of barotropic fluids. Afterwards, we compute the deceleration and jerk parameters, evaluating at our epoch, namely z = 0 , and at z =z&lt;SUB&gt;eq&lt;/SUB&gt; . Thus, by Taylor expanding around current time the Hubble rate, luminosity and angular distances, we substitute the theoretical expressions obtained from the aforementioned generic dark energy model, defining a correspondence between quantities evaluated at z = 0 and z =z&lt;SUB&gt;eq&lt;/SUB&gt; . In so doing, we directly fit these quantities by means of current data sets, involving the most recent Pantheon type Ia supernovae, baryonic acoustic oscillation and Hubble rate points. We consider two hierarchies in our fitting procedures and compare our findings in the spatially-flat universe first and including spatial curvature, later. We assess constraints on the overall equation of state of the universe and its first derivative. We compare our results with those predicted by the standard ΛCDM paradigm. Specifically, our findings are in agreement at the 2 σ confidence level, assuming a constant dark energy term. However, our analysis does not rule out the possibility of a slight evolution of dark energy, indicating a small deviation from the scenario of a pure cosmological constant. In particular, the possible departures appear consistent with a phenomenological ωCDM model, rather than more complicated dark energy parameterizations.</td><td>2023-12-00</td><td>2023PDU....4201298A</td><td>[&apos;2023arXiv230810060G&apos;]</td></tr>\n",
       "<tr><td>[&apos;Luo, M. J.&apos;]</td><td>The Ricci flow and the early universe</td><td>A framework of quantum spacetime reference frame is proposed and reviewed, in which the quantum spacetime at the Gaussian approximation is deformed by the Ricci flow. At sufficient large scale, the Ricci flow not only smooths out local small irregularities making the universe a homogeneous and isotropic Friedmann-Robertson-Walker metric, but also develops a local singularity at the physical-time origin. Due to the phenomenological suppression of the non-Gaussian primordial perturbations, we assume the validity of the Ricci flow applying to the high curvature region near the local singularity of the early universe. The no-local-collapsing theorem of Perelman ensures the existence of a canonical neighborhood around the large curvature pinching point, which resembles a gradient shrinking Ricci soliton (GSRS) solution of the Ricci flow. Without any inflaton field, the GSRS naturally reproduces an exact inflationary deSitter universe near the singularity at the leading order. Without any rolling-down behavior of inflaton, the deviation from exact deSitter described by the &quot;slow roll parameters&quot; can be calculated by a small deviation from the singular flow-time via the Ricci flow, and the primordial perturbations can also be studied on the GSRS background, the power spectrum of the scalar perturbation agrees with present observations, and the one of the tensor perturbation is predicted too small to be detectable than the standard inflation. The previous treatment of the cosmological constant and the effective gravity are also briefly reviewed in the framework. So we argue that the Ricci flow provides us a possible unified view and treatment of the late epoch accelerating expansion and early epoch inflation of the universe without introducing dark energy or inflaton (dark energy of the second kind).</td><td>2023-11-00</td><td>2023AnPhy.45869452L</td><td>[&apos;2022AnPhy.44168861L&apos;, &apos;2023IJMPD..3250022L&apos;, &apos;2023IJTP...62...91L&apos;]</td></tr>\n",

Amon &amp;amp; Efstathiou used KiDS-1000 cosmic shear measurements to propose that this tension can be reconciled if the matter fluctuation spectrum is suppressed more strongly on non-linear scales than assumed in state-of-the-art hydrodynamical simulations. In this paper, we investigate cosmic shear data from the Dark Energy Survey (DES) Year 3. The non-linear suppression of the matter power spectrum required to resolve the S&lt;SUB&gt;8&lt;/SUB&gt; tension between DES and the Planck ΛCDM model is not as strong as inferred using KiDS data, but is still more extreme than predictions from recent numerical simulations. An alternative possibility is that non-standard dark matter contributes to the required suppression. We investigate the redshift and scale dependence of the suppression of the matter power spectrum. If our proposed explanation of the S&lt;SUB&gt;8&lt;/SUB&gt; tension is correct, the required suppression must extend into the mildly non-linear regime to wavenumbers $k\\sim 0.2 \\, h\\, {\\rm Mpc}^{-1}$.

We present the selection and characterization of high-redshift galaxy samples using DES Year 3 data, and the analysis of their galaxy clustering measurements. In particular, we use galaxies that are fainter than those used in the previous DES Year 3 analyses and a Bayesian redshift scheme to define three tomographic bins with mean redshifts around z ~ 0.9, 1.2, and 1.5, which extend the redshift coverage of the fiducial DES Year 3 analysis. These samples contain a total of about 9 million galaxies, and their galaxy density is more than 2 times higher than those in the DES Year 3 fiducial case. We characterize the redshift uncertainties of the samples, including the usage of various spectroscopic and high-quality redshift samples, and we develop a machine-learning method to correct for correlations between galaxy density and survey observing conditions.

Our analysis reveals three distinct cases arising from the solutions to the Chern-Simons field equations, which depend on the chosen parameters. In the first two cases, we observe confirmation of the accelerated expansion of the universe, consistent with the predicted range of - 1 &amp;lt; ω &amp;lt; 0 . However, in the third case, the depicted behavior exhibits a phantom-like nature. It is important to note that irrespective of the case, the generalized holographic dark energy model supports the transition from deceleration to acceleration, aligning well with observational data.
